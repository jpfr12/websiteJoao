* This website was a homework from college  

* I created this site using Bootstrap Framework:  

    * The icons on the webside were provided by "Bootstrap Icons"  

    * Thanks to this Framework the webside is responsive  
    
* Decided to add this website on "GitHub pages" for fun (and because it is free)
